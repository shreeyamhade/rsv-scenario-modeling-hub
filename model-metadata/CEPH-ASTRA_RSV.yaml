methods: "Age-structured ordinary differential equations model"
methods_long: "The model framework is based on ordinary differential equations and age-stratified contact matrices derived from both macro (census) and micro (survey) data sources. RSV transmissibility and the initial number of active infections is calibrated using hospitalization data from RSV-Net for the 2022-2023, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 seasons. The age- and location-dependent infection-to-hospitalization risks are adjusted to reproduce empirical hospitalization attack rates. The posterior parameter distributions are estimated by our optimization procedure and their prior distributions are based on RSV literature."
